# Operational-Systems
This repository houses my projects for the 'Operational Systems' course offered by the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics at the University of Warsaw (here is the link to that [course](https://usosweb.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&prz_kod=1000-212bAKSO)). It also includes numerous laboratory sessions.

# What does this repository contain?
This repository contains three main projects: the first one in C, while the other two are written in Assembly. Each project will have its own `README.md` with the precise information about problem it addresses and instructions on how to compile it.
